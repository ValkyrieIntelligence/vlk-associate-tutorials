    "#### Repository\n",
    "Git stores all of your changes in a repository. A repository is essentially a folder on your computer that also stores a history of all of the snapshots of your codebase.\n",

Creating a new branch is a way to develop and code modifications or new features but not affect the master (or dev) branch.  We can also say that branches create another line of development in the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forking\n",
